            <div class="write-up-header">What is this?</div>
            <div class="write-up-contents">Using US Census data, this visualization examines the gender and ethnic trends behind college degrees and the outcomes for graduates. This analysis not only offers a raw insight into the number of degree holders, employment, and median income but also scales those numbers proportional to
            <ul>
               <li>the national populations of the overall gender and ethnic groups examined</li>
               <li>the populations that achieved the same degrees</li>
            </ul>
            This allows users to determine not just how many men achieved a degree in Literature, for example, but what percent of men nation-wide hold that degree and what percent of all graduates in the field are male.

            <div class="write-up-contents">
              <p>This visualization underscores an unavoidable complexity in discussing educational background and post-college outcomes. Even in the broad scope of the US Census, the data, like truth, resist simplicity (Green).</p> 
              <p>Let's take some examples... While this visualization highlights similarity between genders in overall educational attainment, some degrees like "Engineering" have a great deal more men than women. However, at the same time, some fields like "Psychology" have a disproportionate number of females compared to males. Meanwhile, looking at unemployment, men are jobless at higher rates in "Communications" than their female counterparts but women suffer from higher unemployment than men in "Computers, maths, and stats". Of course, this extends far beyond gender and unemployment. For example, "White" Americans hold the lion's share of bachelor's degrees but, adjusting by the size of the overall national population per ethnic group, it turns out that "Asians" earn degrees at higher rates. Additionally, regardless of gender, "African Americans" have higher unemployment rates than all other ethic groups, even after they achieve the same degree. Yet, still, the numbers become fairly close in some disciplines like "Education". That said, men certainly earn more income than their female counterparts in all fields but, even in that generalization, the disparity varies greatly depending on the discipline at hand. Given this nuance, this project cannot tell its readers what to think but it can invite them to dive deeply into the data, asking them to mouse over the visualization and to configure the radio buttons that choose the metrics displayed.</p>
              <p>Note that the <a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/2012pubs/acs-18.pdf">US Census provides a description of each category</a> (pg 21).</p>

          <div class="write-up-section">
            <div class="write-up-header">What should I know about the data?</div>
            <div class="write-up-contents">While this project hopes to eventually draw data directly from an API published by the US Census, it currently combines a few different Census reports. First, earnings information comes from <a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/2012pubs/acsbr11-10.pdf">a 2012 report</a> and the <a href="http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_11_5YR_S2402&prodType=table">US Census Fact Finder</a>, both using 2011 American Community Survey information. However, the <a href="https://www.census.gov/people/io/files/Table%201.%20Field%20of%20degree.xlsx">number of people with each degree</a>, <a href="https://www.census.gov/people/io/files/Table%203.%20Unemployment.xlsx">unemployment</a>, and overall population by age and ethnicity (<a href="http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml?refresh=t">US Census Fact Finder</a>) come from the 2012 American Community Survey. The 2011 income data use median income for those over the age of 16 when discussing the general population while median income for those with a bachelor's degree starts at age 25. The 2012 data focus on ages 25-64. So, this report attempts to use the data consistently (not display data from different ACS years at the same time) but there are still multiple datasets represented.

            <div class="write-up-header">I have some thoughts about this visual design. Any papers that you suggest I review?</div>

                <p>Anyway, despite some room for improvement, I hope this work takes a logical step in those long lines of thought within visualization science. All that said, these design considerations and the overall visual structure are very unlikely to suit general purpose visualization and the their tools. Some trade-offs were made in regards to the dynamics of this very specific dataset.</p>
